# Inkscpae App Icon Generator

I got tired of having to manually export different icon size when I made an icon in inkscape, so I made this plugin to automate it

## TODO

* Add Android icon support
* Add tests to make sure the icon meets the standards for whatever app store it is being designed for
* refactor the python code to use subprocesses
* add option to specify custom path to save to
* clean up output
